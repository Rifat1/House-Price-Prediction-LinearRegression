## House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

**Objective:**  
Predict housing prices using structured data and a linear regression model, incorporating feature engineering and outlier handling.

**Technologies Used:**  
Python, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn

---

### Role and Contributions

- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **correlation analysis** to identify key features (e.g., `sqft_living`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, etc.)
- Engineered new features such as:
  - `price_per_sqft`
  - `bed_bath_ratio`  
    to improve model performance
- Handled **outliers** and **missing data** to ensure data quality
- Trained and evaluated a **multiple linear regression model** using:
  - **R² score**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

---

### Outcomes

- Achieved **R² score of ~0.85** on the test dataset
- Delivered an **interpretable model** with feature importance analysis
